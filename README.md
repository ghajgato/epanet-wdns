# epanet-wdns
Water distribution networks in EPANET-compatible file format.

### Analyze water distribution networks
There are some auxiliary (conversion, snooping, etc.) scripts in the *notebook* directory. You can run these notebooks from an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment by cloning the repo and invoking `conda env create --file environment.yaml` from the root directory of the repository.

After that, you have to activate the `epanet-wdns` environment and run a Jupyter Notebook server on your machine.
